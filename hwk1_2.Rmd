A log-normal distribution is a probability distribution with a normally distributed logarithm of a random variable. Both meam and sigma of this distribution can be calculated applying the respective equations and knowing in advance the arithmetic mean and sigma (as it is stated in the code below):

```{r}
mu <- 1
sd <- 0.25
logmu <- log(mu^2 / sqrt(sd^2 + mu^2))
logsd <- sqrt(log(1 + (sd^2 / mu^2)))
distr <- rlnorm(n=100, logmu, logsd)
mean(distr)
sd(distr)
hist(distr, main = "Histogram of the log-normal distribution", xlab = "distribution")
```

When plotting the histogram of the distribution, we see that its location is centered around a value of 1 and the shape correlated with the value of sigma.
